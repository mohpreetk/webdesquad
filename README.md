Creating a website for Web developers to connect and share ideas.
This is a PHP based website using login and sessions to create developer profiles. 
- This website stores the data in sql server and remembers passwords in hashcode using secure matching.
- All the CRUD operations are being performed in the website.
- CSS animations have been introduced for a fun touch.
